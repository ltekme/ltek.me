Back to a clean slate. One of the most important things I have learned from this is to only use what you really need. AWS isn't meant for everything; if you don't really, really need it, don't use it.

Going back to Vercel and having the ability to change things whenever I want, without worrying about breaking anything, while allowing me to completely disregard the entire infrastructure is a lot less to worry about than being in control of everything.

The number of times I nearly broke my entire domain because a CloudFormation stack wanted to delete a Route 53 zone when something needed to be changed is not fun; it's terrifying when it appears in the change set. Although many call it a skill issue, fair enough.

Sometimes, being in control is not really the place you want to be.
